* first, start the notist backend server as you normally do
* make sure 'apiHost' in config.json is set to either 'localhost:3000' (if your backend server is running locally) or 'notist.herokuapp.com' (if you want to connect to the production server).
* then run 'gulp dev' or 'gulp watch' (for hot loading)
* go to chrome://extensions -> 'load unpacked extension' -> load the newly created `dist` directory
