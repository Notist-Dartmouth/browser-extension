* first, start the notist backend server as you normally do
* then run 'gulp dev' or 'gulp watch' (for hot loading) - do 'gulp prod' instead if you want to connect with the production backend api (notist.herokuapp.com), rather than one running on localhost.
* go to chrome://extensions -> 'load unpacked extension' -> load the newly created `dist` directory
